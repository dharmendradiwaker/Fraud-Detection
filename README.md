Credit default remains a significant concern within the financial landscape, impacting businesses and individuals alike. Timely prediction of credit default holds the potential to mitigate financial risks and optimize lending decisions. This report is centered around developing a machine learning-driven framework for credit default prediction based on relevant financial attributes. The objective is to construct an accurate and efficient system capable of assisting financial institutions in evaluating the likelihood of credit default. By analysing a range of financial parameters, this study aims to forecast whether a credit applicant is prone to defaulting, employing a suite of machine learning classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and more.
